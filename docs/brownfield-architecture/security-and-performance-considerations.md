# Security and Performance Considerations

## Security Implementation Status
- ✅ Supabase Auth with RLS capabilities
- ✅ Environment variable configuration for API keys
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ⚠️ Agent data access controls need enhancement
- ❌ Rate limiting not implemented

## Performance Characteristics
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with connection pooling
- **Agent Response Time**: ~800 token limit helps with latency
- **Memory Usage**: Session cleanup not implemented (potential leak)
- **Concurrent Users**: Not tested at scale per PRD requirements

## Critical Performance Issues
1. **No Redis Caching**: All data hits PostgreSQL
2. **Synchronous Embeddings**: Blocks response time
3. **Session Cleanup**: Memory grows unbounded
4. **No Connection Limits**: Database connections not managed
